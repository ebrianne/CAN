\end{large}
\end{center}
This note presents the results obtained with the CALICE \emph{Analog Hadronic Calorimeter} engineering prototype at the SPS CERN testbeam campaign in 2015. The analysis presents the timing calibration and includes timing distributions for muon, electron and pion beams. The results are compared to several \geant version 10.1 physics lists.\\
